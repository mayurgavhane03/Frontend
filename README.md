###1
- First of all i just created a basic struction of frontend and backend
like i created a schema only for movie my schema contain title type links 480p 720p 1080p
etc genre  director creator
- after to put data in the backend i created basic from in the react 
- the main things in this website is single schmea whcih is used for movie and series 
- the form of the schema is also very complecated 
- and day by day in modify my all components like i created main page where all data will going to show and 
- on mainpage i shown all the main object of the movies object contain image and title of the movie 
and whenever user click on the card in url i crete differect url like movie/movieid and in movie detail page i fetchdata of that id 
- and to maintain all the data in the website i use redux toolkit  whenever website loads all data first store in the react store and then pass
    into the react components
-i also impleented the dynamic search  for searching movies like if user is on movie detail page and want to search for movie he has to just 
click on serach par whenver he type for movie it brings all movie on main page  
- the most impartant part of the website is secuiring all the data 
 for that i use crypto.js which ecrypt data the whenever we try to fetchh data first it comes in a string from we have first decrypt that data 

 - created the navbar footer 
 - desable the right click onthe whole application  
 ### FOR INCREPYTION AND DECRYPTION I USE CRYPTO.JS
